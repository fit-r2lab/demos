    "* Second, it serves as an exemple of what we can do with R2lab and all its tools, like nepi-ng. \n",
    "* Its third purpose is to illustrate how similar results can be presented inside a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the experiment has been split into two parts:\n",
    "* Data acquisition; this has been automated inside a customizable script. You can run it with a number of different arguments - that typically describe the environment that you want to use.\n",
    "* Visualization; the second part of this notebook shows how the data gathered can be interactivelyt visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, this git repo contains pre-gathered data, that you can visualize right away, without the need to go through the full process of account creation, reservation and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the fact that R2lab is an anechoic chamber, and to the information you can find in this notebook, if the hardware keeps the same properties, the experiment should be 100% reproducible."

Essentially this is a constant in our study; using the current notebook, researchers should be, for example, able to investigate whether other subsets could be suitable as well;\n",

    "* **protocol** of course, selecting the protocol among OLSR and batman is an obvious choice when collecting data;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **interference** - the primary influential setting that allows us to create diverse routing patterns, is our ability to emit noise on the experimental wireless channel; the level of that interference noise is the key external parameter that allows to actually create multi-hop routing schemes; without that noise, all node pairs essentially can talk directly to one another. Note that for that purpose, we selected one node that has a USRP board - namely node 30 ; again this is a parameter in the code, and external researchers have the ability to check if the location of the scrambler node - the one that emits noise - has an impact or not on the results, but as far as we are concerned, we always use the same node for that purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **wireless settings** - the code also comes with all the usual wireless settings - channel, tx_power, number of antennas, etc.. - as parameters, but as far as we are concerned, these have been set to one value - discussed below - that best suits our needs. "
